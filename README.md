## Cloning
You should install Git before doing this. If you don't have git, go away you uncultured swine. Why are you even here?

Since this is a PROS project, you should download PROS.

CD into the desired folder where you want it to be installed via command prompt, and type this.
```
git clone git@github.com:HoneySpiceLatte/tower_takeover.git
```
